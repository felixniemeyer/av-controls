Protocol Package:
- The control implementations have significant duplication in their class structure - they could
benefit from better base classes and factory patterns
- The createSenderFromSpec function we worked on earlier is a good example of this - all controls
follow similar patterns

Controller Package:
- Touch/mouse handling is duplicated across many controls (Fader, Dots, Joystick) - this could be
extracted into reusable Vue composables
- The control styling logic has similar patterns that could be unified

Platform Frontend:
- Token/authentication management appears scattered and could be centralized
- API calling patterns could be more consistent
